      <div class="about">
        <img src="./img/profile.png" alt="picture of Matt Brems">
        <div class="bio">
          <p>I'm Matt Brems and I currently teach data science with <u><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/locations/washington-dc">General Assembly.</a></u> I'm afforded the great opportunity and responsibility to train data scientists across the United States. </p>

          <p>Why am I a data science instructor? </p>
          <ul>
          <li> I firmly believe that our world is made better when decisions are informed by data.
          <li> Data science is made better by properly relying on rigorous statistical methods.
          <li> Rigorous statistical methods are often inaccessible without serious academic training in mathematics.
          <li> Our world does not reach its full potential if we limit data-driven decision-making to those with serious academic training.
          </ul>

          <p> I'm particularly passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical statistics and real-world insights. I want to contribute my voice to the chorus of individuals who work tirelessly to make data-driven decision-making accessible, sexy, and fun - to all people, not just those who enjoy calculus or who know what a maximum likelihood estimator is. </p>

          <p> Previously, I did political data work for <u><a href="0ptimus.com">0ptimus Consulting</a></u>, earned my M.S. in statistics from <u><a href="https://stat.osu.edu/">Ohio State</a></u>, and studied math, economics and political science at <u><a href="http://franklincollege.edu/">Franklin College</a></u>. </p>

          <p> Beyond General Assembly, I spend my time buying and partially reading statistics textbooks, overcaffeinating, <u><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70105212?trackId=14170289&tctx=0%2C0%2C03d54e89-c142-4bc5-9cf4-c9903291a6db-39947801%2Ce153eece-7102-492b-97ae-16856acc381c_14053268X3XX1522561190186%2Ce153eece-7102-492b-97ae-16856acc381c_ROOT"> re-watching TV shows</a></u>, or ordering unhealthy delivery food with my boyfriend and our pug. </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p> While I have worked in statistical genetics and have dabbled in cryptography and discrete topology, I invest most of my time in identifying ways to be a better educator. I believe quantitative literacy and statistical savvy are two underrated skills and that society's needs here exceed the current state of statistical education. </p>

      <p> Whether it's articulating the process for principal component analysis or discussing how thinking probabilistically is hard but important, I attempt to identify important topics and find a meaningful way to communicate these topics to people with various technical backgronds. </p>

      <p> To this end, I've written a number of posts. I'm probably proudest of the following: </p>
      <ul>
      <li><u><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c">"A One-Stop Shop for Principal Component Analysis,"</a></u> a longer post designed to thoroughly yet gently explain PCA.
      <li><u><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/people-are-talking-about-reproducibility-crises-and-p-values-and-i-feel-like-i-should-28b5d5fbe70a">"People are talking about 'reproducibility crises' and 'p-values' and I feel like I should understand but my eyes are already glazing over… can you help?,"</a></u> a post that aims to intuitively communicate what the reproducibility crisis is, why it's a big deal, how p-values might be part of the problem, and how we can attempt to fix the issue.
      <li><u><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-new-hot-take-machine-learning-is-racist-1319943cf1fe">"The New Hot Take: Machine Learning is Racist,"</a></u> a post describing how algorithms aren't, by themselves, racist - they have help.
      </ul>
